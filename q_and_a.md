# Q&A

Here are some questions to test your understanding of the lesson.

1.  What is the fundamental concept behind how diffusion models generate images?
2.  What is the purpose of a `negative_prompt`? Provide an example of how you might use one.
3.  Explain the role of the `guidance_scale` parameter in the image generation pipeline.
4.  Why is it beneficial to move the Stable Diffusion pipeline to a CUDA-enabled GPU if one is available?
5.  Besides the prompt, name two other parameters that can be used to control the image generation process and briefly describe their function.
6.  What is a "pipeline" in the context of the `diffusers` library?
7.  According to the guide, what is one ethical consideration to keep in mind when generating images with AI?
